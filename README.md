# laa-dces-report-service

This is a Java based Spring Boot application hosted on [MOJ Cloud Platform](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/concepts/about-the-cloud-platform.html).

### Decrypting docker-compose.override.yml

The `docker-compose.override.yml` is encrypted using [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt).

To run the app locally you need to be able to decrypt this file.

You will first need to create a GPG key. See [Create a GPG Key](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/create-a-gpg-key.html) for details on how to do this with `GPGTools` (GUI) or `gpg` (command line).
You can install either from a terminal or just download the UI version.

```
brew update
brew install gpg
brew install git-crypt
```

Once you have done this, a team member who already has access can add your key by running `git-crypt add-gpg-user USER_ID`\* and creating a pull request to this repo.

Once this has been merged you can decrypt your local copy of the repository by running `git-crypt unlock`.

\*`USER_ID` can be your key ID, a full fingerprint, an email address, or anything else that uniquely identifies a public key to GPG (see "HOW TO SPECIFY A USER ID" in the gpg man page).
The apps should then startup cleanly if you run

### Application Set up

Clone Repository

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/laa-dces-report-service.git

cd dces-report-service
```

Make sure all tests are passed by running following ‘gradle’ Command

```sh
./gradlew clean test
```

You will need to build the artifacts for the source code, using `gradle`.

```sh
./gradlew clean build
```

```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

laa-dces-report-service application will be running on http://localhost:8089

### How to generate reports on demand

To run reports manually, it is required to be able to access the pods from local machine. If you need help read section #How-to-access-the-pods for help.  

If it is required to trigger the report manually follow these simple instructions:

1. get access to the container where the app is running
2. Use the command to launch the corresponding report
3. Make sure to specify the start and end date in the correct format (dd.MM.yyyy)

There are 2 ways of doing this, you can either use the script provided for ease or type the full CURL command. 

Check the following examples:

#### For contributions:
```sh
./contributionsReportAdHoc.sh 01.01.2021 26.01.2021
```
or  
```shell
curl -G localhost:8089/api/internal/v1/dces/report/contributions/01.01.2021/26.01.2021
```

#### For FDCs:
```sh
./fdcReportAdHoc.sh 01.01.2021 26.01.2021  
```

or
```sh
curl -G localhost:8089/api/internal/v1/dces/report/fdc/01.01.2021/26.01.2021
```

### How to access the pods:

In order to access the pods, it is required to have Kubernetes installed and configured in your local machine. If you need help, check these documents:  
* [Java Project Setup - Accessing Clusters](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ASLST/pages/3761963077/Java+Project+Setup+with+CircleCI+and+Helm+on+Cloud+Platform#Accessing-the-clusters)
* [Connecting to the Cloud Platform's Kubernetes cluster - Cloud Platform User Guide](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/getting-started/kubectl-config.html#installing-kubectl)  

Assuming Kubernetes is all setup, follow these steps to access the pods.

1. Use the following command from terminal:  
```sh
kubectl get pods -n {nameSpace}
```  

Possible values for `nameSpace` are:
* laa-dces-report-service-dev
* laa-dces-report-service-uat
* laa-dces-report-service-staging
* laa-dces-report-service-prod

Check response from command below, you will need that for the following step
```sh
kubectl get pods -n {nameSpace}    
```
Output:  

    NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE  
    {poddName}                           1/1     Running   0          18m    

2. Access the pod console using the following command:   

```sh
kubectl exec -it {podName} -n {nameSpace} -- sh
```

Example:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n laa-dces-report-service-readme
```  

Output should be similar to this:  

    NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE  
    laa-dces-report-service-00000-xxxxx   1/1     Running   0          18m  

```shell
kubectl exec -it laa-dces-report-service-00000-xxxxx -n laa-dces-report-service-readme -- sh
```

That should give you access to the pods terminal.
